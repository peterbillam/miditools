<h3><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h3>
<p>Notes input on the <I>fixed-channels</I>
are transmitted unchanged to the output
(<A HREF="#n">unless <B>-n</B></A>),
but notes received in the <I>adjust-channels</I>
have their pitches changed before being output.
&nbsp;
<I>midichord</I> can be used either:
<OL><LI><A HREF="#default_mode">
to synthesise chords on the adjust-channels
to accompany a solo on a fixed-channels (the default mode),</A>
</LI><LI><A HREF="#aco_mode">
or to adjust the notes of a solo to not conflict
with the notes on the fixed-channels (<B>-aco</B> mode).</A>
</LI></OL>
</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="default_mode">DEFAULT MODE</a></h3>
<p>By default, <I>midichord</I> remembers
all non-semitone-dischord notes in a &quot;fixed-channel&quot;
(or channels), generating a changing set of &quot;chord&quot; notes,
which can be played by notes in a &quot;adjust-channel&quot;.
Any note in a fixed-channel remains as part of the Reigning Chord,
and continues there until contradicted by a subsequent note in a
fixed-channel, where &quot;contradiction&quot; means a semitone-dischord.
</p><p>
Notes input on the fixed-channels are also,
<A HREF="#n">by default</A>, transmitted unchanged to the output.
But notes received in the adjust-channels have their pitches changed,
to conform to the Reigning Chord, before being output.
</p><p>
A <strong>black note in a adjust-channel plays the whole chord</strong>,
in close harmony, inverted to start just above that note.
</p><p>
A <strong>white note in a adjust-channel plays one of the chord-notes</strong>
in the same octave.
The rules governing which one are a bit complicated;
there are seven white keys in each octave, but the number
of notes in the chord varies all the time, from one to six.
The <strong>D</strong> key will always output the lowest chord-note in its
octave, and the <strong>B</strong> key will usually output the higest.
Between those two, the default mapping of key to chord-note
ascends as smoothly as possible subject to the condition that
each key produces a different chord-note from the previous key,
so that it will avoid generating repeated notes unless that was intended.
</p><p>
The <strong>-m</strong> option enforces a simpler mapping:
the note is chosen according to the <strong>m</strong>odulus of the key-number,
so that the white keys just cycle through the chord notes.
This is useful for generating arpeggios,
because if there are three or more chord-notes
then three neighbouring white keys will generate three different notes.
</p><p>
When <em>midichord</em> starts, the Reigning Chord is empty.
So, until the first note in a fixed-channel,
the adjust-channels, whatever their input,  will produce no output.
The &quot;all-notes-off&quot; midi-controller (cc123) in one of the
adjust-channels clears the Reigning Chord, resulting again in silence.
This can be a graceful way to end a piece, to avoid having to fade out
an endlessly recycling accompaniment.
</p><p>
If you are improvising in a fixed-channel,
try to play your solo line a tiny bit <I>ahead</I> of the chord beat;
it doesn't have to be audible - a millisecond will do.
</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="aco_mode">ON-NOTE MODE and CLOSEST MODE</a></h3>
<p>
If the <B>-ao</B> sub-option is used,
the adjust-channel notes are adjusted to avoid any semitone-dischord
with one of the currently <B>O</B>n notes in a fixed-channel.
</p><p>
With the <B>-ac</B> sub-option there is no difference between
how the white keys and the black keys are treated;
the note is chosen <B>C</B>losest to the adjust-channel note.
This is usually used in conjunction with the <B>o</B> sub-option,
i.e. <B>-aco</B>, with slow-moving fixed-channel notes
and a faster-moving solo on the adjust-channel.

</p>

</h3>
<P>
The sub-options of <B>-a</B> affect
the way the pitches in the adjust-channels get adjusted.
They can be concatenated in the same argument,
for example <B>-aco</B> which is a useful way to fix dischordant notes
in a fast solo over a a slower channel which is setting the harmony;
also <B>-ato</B>
or <B>-acot</B> etc.
</P>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="a" class="item"><em>-a 4,5</em></a></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this example, the midi channels <strong>4</strong> and <strong>5</strong>
will be used for the '<B>a</B>djustable' voices.
Notes input on those channels are <em>not</em> transmitted to the output;
they are used to decide which of the current chord-notes will be output.</p>
<p>If the input-note is a black key, then all the current chord-notes
are output, in a chord. The chord will be in close position,
and inverted so that its lowest note is not lower than the input-note.
</p><p>
If the input-note is a white key,
then only <em>one</em> of the current chord-notes will be output.
If the input-note is a C then the lowest chord-note in that octave is chosen,
and if the input-note is a D the the second-lowest,
and thereafter the chosen chord-note meanders upwards
(there are at most 6 chord-notes, but there are 7 white notes in an octave).
</p><p>
In either case, the chord-notes are output
on the same channel as the input note came in on,
and the note's duration and velocity (or volume) are also conserved.</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="ac" class="item"><em>-ac</em></a></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This causes all adjust-channel keys to be translated differently into
the choice of adjusted-note: by taking the closest available pitch that
is not discordant with a fixed-channel.
It is incompatible with the
<B><A HREF="#am">-am option</A></B>.
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="am" class="item"><em>-am</em></a></strong></dt>
<dd><p>
This causes adjust-channel white-keys to be translated differently into
the choice of chord-note: by taking the <B>M</B>odulus of the key-number.
If any input-note is a C then the lowest available
chord-note in that octave is chosen,
if the input-note is a D the the second-lowest,
and so on, but returning to the lowest
chord-note and starting again after reaching the highest;
so cycling through the chord-notes.
It is incompatible with the
<B><A HREF="#ac">-ac option</A></B>.
</dd>
</p></dd>

<dt><strong><a name="ao" class="item"><em>-ao</em></a></strong></dt>
<dd><p>
This causes the Reigning chord to consist of only the currently
<B>O</B>n notes of the fixed-channels;
in other words the <I>memory</I> of a fixed-channel note will not persist.
It allows a solo line more freedom, and is often used in combination with 
<B><A HREF="#ac">-ac</A></B>&nbsp;
for example
<B>-aco</B>
</p><p>
Do not confuse this <B>-ao sub-option</B> with the
<B><A HREF="#o">top-level -o option</A></B> which sets the ALSA output port.
</p></dd>

<dt><strong><a name="ar" class="item"><em>-ar</em></a></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>
This introduces a tendancy to use <B>R</B>ests on white adjust-channel-notes,
if they would otherwise repeat the adjusted-pitch most recently played.
It is not very compatible with the
<B><A HREF="#ao">-ao option</A></B>.
</p></dd>

<dt><strong><a name="at" class="item"><em>-at</em></a></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>
This causes any chord-notes contradicted by a fixed-note to be 
immediately <B>T</B>erminated.
&nbsp;
The default is to allow the chord-note to continue to its normal duration.
Using <B>-at</B> gives a harmonically cleaner and lighter sound,
but it can result in some ugly short notes in the adjust-channels.
You may need to use <B>-at</B> if your chord-notes are very long notes.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h3><a name="other_options">OTHER OPTIONS</a> : &nbsp;
<A HREF="#f">-f</A>, &nbsp;

<A HREF="#o">-o</A>
</h3>
<dl>

<dt><strong><a name="f" class="item"><em>-f 0,1</em></a></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this example, the midi channels <strong>0</strong> and <strong>1</strong> (out of 0...15)
will be treated as the '<B>f</B>ixed' voices, or 'free' voices,
and the adjustable-notes will be chosen so as not to be discordant with them.
In this context, an interval of a semitone
(plus or minus any number of octaves) is treated as a dischord.
Notes on the fixed-channels (or any other non-adjust-channels)
will by default also be transmitted unchanged to the output,
though this can be changed
<A HREF="#n">with the <B>-n</B> option</A>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="n" class="item"><em>-n</em></a></strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This causes <I>midichord</I> to <B>n</B>ot transmit
the <B>n</B>on-adjust-channels
(including the fixed-channels,
and all the other channels which are neither fixed nor adjusted).
&nbsp;
This is useful because it allows <I>midichord</I> and
<I><A HREF="midiecho.html">midiecho</A></I> to be run in parallel,
for example both from 14:0 to 14:1 (where Midi Through is 14),
without outputting the non-adjust-channels in duplicate.</p>
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="Q" class="item"><em>-Q</em></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This causes <em>midichord</em> to run in <strong>Q</strong>uiet mode,
in which nothing is printed to the screen;
this is useful in scripts and Makefiles,
and only makes sense in real-time mode (with <strong>-i</strong>).
&nbsp;
In Quiet mode, <em>midichord</em> will terminate if one of its ALSA connections
becomes disconnected.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="i" class="item"><em>-i 32:0</em> or <em>-i ProKeys</em></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This option puts <em>midichord</em> into raw-midi
(or real-time, or midi-on-the-wire) mode, and takes the
midi-data from the specified ALSA-port or ports.<BR>
If the ALSA port is specified as <B>0</B> then <em>midichord</em>
will start up in real-time mode but without connecting from anything.<BR>
You can check out the available ports with the command
<em>arecordmidi -l</em> or <em>aconnect -il</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="o" class="item"><em>-o 128:0</em> or <em>-o TiMidity</em></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This option sets the ALSA-port or ports to which the midi output will
be sent.  You can check out the available ports with the command
<em>aplaymidi -l</em> or <em>aconnect -ol</em>.
The default ouput-port (if only <strong>-i</strong> option is present)
is the environment variable $ALSA_OUTPUT_PORTS</p>

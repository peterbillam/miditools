<H3><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></H3>
<p><i>midiloop</i> creates an ALSA-MIDI client, and records and replays
sets of loops. There can be up to sixteen Loopsets. Each loopset can have
up to sixteen midi-channels, each of which can be muted or unmuted.</p>

<p>Once <i>midiloop</i> is launched, all the user-interface is driven
by the keys of the midi-keyboard (not the computer-keyboard). This leads
to fast operation in a performance situation. The user-interface depends
on the computer-screen being visible by the performer, because it tells
you what the current status is and what your options are.</p>

<p>The top note of the keyboard switches you into and out of
command-mode. All other data is entered using the numbers 0..15, which
are mapped onto some of the white notes (see USER INTERFACE).</p>

<p>This also allows a whole set-up, with several loops and many channels,
to be performed by notes in a standard midi-file (see the <b>-m</b>
option).</p>

<p>Each loopset has a basic barlength in seconds, but each channel
within that loopset can loop at an integer multiple (1..15) of that
basic barlength. For example, the drums could loop at 1.8 seconds,
but the bass could play a 3.6-second riff, and the organ could play a
7.2-second sequence.</p>

<p>All changes in what&#39;s being played (<i>Play/Pause, Mute, Unmute,
GotoMuting, GotoLoopset)</i> take place not immediately but at the
next barline. This means a <i>midiloop</i> performance never loses
the beat.</p>

<HR>
<H3><a name="userinterface">USER INTERFACE</a></H3>

<p>The user-interface is built for speed during performance. Your
data-input-device is the white keys on your midi-keyboard;
<i>midiloop</i>&#39;s output-device is the computer-screen.</p>

<p>The top note on your (88-, 61-, 49- or 25-note) midi-keyboard toggles
you into <b>Command-mode</b>. <i>midiloop</i> will respond immediately,
telling you what the valid choices are, each choice having a number
between 0 and 15.</p>

<p>The only other keys involved express those numbers 0 to 15. The
mapping is the same as is used to express channel-numbers by (at least)
<i>M-Audio Keystation</i> and <i>ProKeys</i> keyboards. (You may want
to number those keys with little white-paper sticky labels.)</p>

<p>On an 88-note keyboard, 0..15 are <b>treble D to e~</b> (midi 62 to 88)
<BR>
On an 61-note or 49-note keyboard, 0..15 are <b>bass D to e~</b>
(midi 38 to 64). (The 61-note keyboard is assumed to have three treble
octaves and two bass octaves, so that middle-C lies left-of-center.)
<BR>
If you have to use a 25-note keyboard, the numbers 0..13 are mapped to
white notes <b>bass c to treble B</b> (midi 48 to 59); that&#39;s all you
need to enter the commands, but it restricts you to 0..13 in channels,
loopsets and mutings.</p>

<p>Whenever you are asked for a number, <i>midiloop</i> displays a list
of the available responses. Numbers not in this list will be ignored by
<i>midiloop</i>. Whenever you are asked for confirmation, the numbers are
(0,1), with <b>0</b> meaning <b>No</b> and <b>1</b> meaning <b>Yes</b>
(as in <i>C</i> and <i>Perl</i>).</p>

<p>A couple of screenshots of <i>midiloop</i>&#39;s side of the dialogue:</p>

<p>Tells <i>midiloop</i> which size <b>K</b>eyboard you&#39;ll be
using. The available values are 88, 61, 49 and 25. This affects the
<i>ModeChangeKey</i>, which is the top note on the keyboard, and the keys
entering the numbers 0 to 15, which on an 88-note keyboard are the white
notes treble D to e~, and on an 49-note keyboard are two octaves lower,
bass D to e~. These conventions are modelled on the Channel-entry keys
used by M-Audio (counting channels 0..15 of course :-).</p>

<p>If no <b>-k</b> option is specified but a <b>-i</b> option has been
provided, then <i>midiloop</i> checks if the number &quot;49&quot;
occurs in its input-client name (eg: <i>Keystation 49e</i>), and if so
sets up for a 49-note keyboard. Otherwise, the default is 88.</p>

The Loopsets are saved in Perl <i>Data::Dumper</i> format,

</dd>
<dt><b><A NAME="mute">Mute</A></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoked by the note (eg: E) corresponding to 1, this allows you to
Mute any of the (currently unmuted) channels.</p>

</dd>
<dt><b><A NAME="unmute">Unute</A></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoked by the note (eg: F) corresponding to 2, this allows you to
Unmute any of the (currently muted) channels.</p>

</dd>
<dt><b><A NAME="record">Record</A></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoked by the note (eg: G) corresponding to 3, this allows you to
Record a loop on the channel your MIDI-keyboard is currently set to. If
that channel already exists, your new recording will overdub onto it;
if that channel does not yet exist, the channel will be created.</p>

<p>If the current LoopSet still has no channels,
you will be asked to choose a Barlength  (in seconds).
All channels in the LoopSet share this same Barlength.
The choices are:<BR>
&nbsp; 0=1.00, &nbsp; 1=1.04, &nbsp; 2=1.08, &nbsp; 3=1.12,
&nbsp; 4=1.16, &nbsp; 5=1.20, &nbsp; 6=1.26, &nbsp; 7=1.32,<BR>
&nbsp; 8=1.38, &nbsp; 9=1.44, &nbsp; 10=1.52, &nbsp; 11=1.60,
12=1.68, &nbsp; 13=1.76, &nbsp; 14=1.84, &nbsp; 15=1.92 seconds.<BR>
If you need a 2-second bar, you use two 1-second bars, and so on.
(If you need finer graduations, you have to <I>SaveLoopsets</I>
 into a  <I>dump</I> file, and edit it by hand.)
</P><P>
In any case, you will be asked to choose how
many bars this channel&#39;s loop will last.
(All channels in a LoopSet share a common BarLength,
but their loops can last for different numbers of bars.)
The choice <B>0</B> means a Free loop; the recording will terminate
at the next barline after you press the ModeChangeKey.
</p><p>
You will be asked whether you want a Metronome. If it&#39;s a
currently-empty LoopSet, you&#39;ll probably want to choose 1=Yes;
but if there are already some recorded channels, you may want to choose
0=No. The Metronome is a guide only; it is not recorded.</p>

<p>Later, when you Mute or UnMute, or change LoopSets, the change will
occur not instantly, but at the next barline. The Metronome will help you
to lay down a loop which has its end-of-loop in a musically sensible place.</p>

</dd>
<dt><b><A NAME="erasechannel">EraseChannel</A></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoked by the note (eg: A) corresponding to 4, this allows you
to Erase any of the channels in the current LoopSet. Do this if, for
example, you&#39;re not happy with what you just recorded. <b>If</b>
there is more than one channel, you will be asked which channel. You
will then be asked for confirmation.</p>

</dd>
<dt><b><A NAME="savemuting">SaveMuting</A></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoked by the note (eg: c) corresponding to 6, this creates a new
Muting, and saves in it the current Muted/Unmuted state of all the
channels. Each LoopSet can have up to 16 Mutings (0..15).</p>

</dd>
<dt><b><A NAME="gotomuting">GotoMuting</A></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoked by the note (eg: d) corresponding to 7, this allows you
to invoke any of your Mutings. The change takes place at the next
Barline. <b>If</b> there is more than one other Muting, you will be
asked which Muting.</p>

</dd>
<dt><b><A NAME="erasemuting">EraseMuting</A></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoked by the note (eg: e) corresponding to 8, this allows you to
Erase any of the Mutings (in in the current LoopSet). <b>If</b> there
is more than one Muting, you will be asked which Muting.</p>

</dd>
<dt><b><A NAME="newmuting">NewMuting</A></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoked by the note (eg: f) corresponding to 9, this creates a new,
empty, LoopSet, then goes to it and enters <i>Pause</i> mode.</p>

</dd>
<dt><b><A NAME="gotoloopset">GotoLoopset</A></b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Invoked by the note (eg: g) corresponding to 10, this allows you to
switch to any one of your LoopSets. <b>If</b> there is more than one
other Loopset, you will be asked which Loopset.</p>

<p><i>GotoLoopset</i> allows you change (at the next Barline) from one

<ul>

<p>Because the user-interface of <i>midiloop</i> uses the midi-keyboard,
it can also be controlled by computer-generated midi files. This allows
loops to be composed using eg: <i>muscript</i>. The <b>-m</b> option
makes this easier.</p>

<p><i>midiloop -m -k 88</i> or <i>midiloop -m -k 49</i> output a set of
variable-definitions for use as a header within <i>muscript</i> files, see
<A HREF="http://www.pjb.com.au/muscript/variables.html">
www.pjb.com.au/muscript/variables.html</A>
</p>

<p>If a filename is given after the <i>-m</i> then its contents are
output after the header. Eg:</p>

<pre><code> midiloop -m /tmp/myloop | muscript -midi | aplaymidi -p midiloop -</code></pre>

<p><code>$CMD</code> is the ModeChangeKey, which toggles in and out
of Command-Mode</p>

<p>Within Command-Mode, the main commands are: <code>$PAUSE</code>
<code>$REC</code> <code>$NEWMUTES</code> <code>$NEWLOOPS</code>
<code>$GOTOLOOPS</code> <code>$SAVE</code> and <code>$QUIT</code></p>

<p>The numbers 0..15 are: <code>$K0</code> <code>$K1</code>
<code>$K2</code> <code>$K3</code> <code>$K4</code> <code>$K5</code>
<code>$K6</code> <code>$K7</code> <code>$K8</code> <code>$K9</code>
<code>$K10</code> <code>$K11</code> <code>$K12</code> <code>$K13</code>
<code>$K14</code> and <code>$K15</code></p>

<p>The binary keys are: <code>$YES</code> and <code>$NO</code></p>

<p>See
<A HREF="http://www.pjb.com.au/midi/free/loop_1">
www.pjb.com.au/midi/free/loop_1</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.pjb.com.au/midi/free/rubycon_1_390s">
www.pjb.com.au/midi/free/rubycon_1_390s</A>
for examples of such a file.<BR>
The author tends to keep these files in
<I>~/midiloop/src/</I></p>

<p>Remember the commands <code>$CMD</code> and <code>$PAUSE</code> are
toggles. Unlike a real human, <i>muscript</i> can&#39;t see what the
screen is saying, so when working in <i>muscript</i> don&#39;t lose
track of which mode it&#39;s in ! Also other commands have a dialogue
which changes with circumstances; for example <code>$GOTOLOOPS</code>
will not ask &quot;<i>Go to which Loopset</i>&quot; if there&#39;s only
one other Loopset.<BR>
Remember also that only one channel can be Recorded at one time, so
<I>muscript</I> resources such as <CODE>cha1+2</CODE> will not work
as intended.
<BR>
To diagnose such problems it helps to play your file at much-reduced speed
so you have time to follow the dialogue, and see at what point it goes wrong.
